# Interpretive Analysis: “Shah Jahan” as a Title for Babur

## Argument

The translation of *شاه جهان* as “King of the World (Babur)” rather than “Shah Jahan (the later emperor)” rests on three intersecting lines of evidence: epigraphic convention, historical chronology, and architectural context.

**1. Epigraphic Parallels** – In early Mughal foundation inscriptions, the generic title *Shah‑i‑Jahan* (King of the World) appears as a formulaic epithet for Babur. For example, the 1527 mosque inscription at Panipat, commissioned by Babur’s governor Mir Hindu Beg, refers to the emperor as *Shah‑i‑Jahan* without using his personal name. This practice mirrors contemporary Timurid chancery style, where rulers were often designated by grandiose titles rather than regnal names. The Mir Baqi inscription follows the same pattern; the absence of the definite article *al‑* suggests it is a title, not a proper noun.

**2. Historical Chronology** – Mir Baqi is documented in the *Bāburnāma* as a noble active in Awadh around 1528. The emperor Shah Jahan, however, did not ascend the throne until 1628—a full century later. It is highly improbable that a mosque built in 1528 would refer to a future emperor unless the inscription were a later replacement. No architectural or archival evidence supports such a replacement; the stone’s weathering and calligraphic style are consistent with early‑16th‑century work.

**3. Architectural Context** – The mosque’s plan and decorative elements (plain sandstone walls, pointed arches, and a single dome) align with other mosques built under Babur’s patronage in North India, such as the Babri Masjid at Ayodhya (if indeed the same structure) and the mosque at Sambhal. These buildings share a characteristic austerity that distinguishes them from the elaborate marble‑and‑pietra‑dura style of Shah Jahan’s reign.

## Conclusion

Treating *Shah Jahan* as a generic title for Babur resolves the anachronism without requiring speculative theories about later alterations. It also reinforces the inscription’s value as a primary source for early Mughal administrative and architectural practices in Ayodhya.
