# Mir Baqi Inscription – Persian Transcription

## Primary Text (Persian)

The inscription is carved in nastaʿlīq script on a sandstone slab. The following is a diplomatic transcription that preserves line breaks and orthographic peculiarities of the original.

```
بانی این مسجد میر باقی است از بندگان شاه جهان
```

## Orthographic Notes

- The inscription consists of a single line.
- The term **باقی** is written with a final ی (ya) without dots, characteristic of early 16th‑century nastaʿlīq.
- **شاه جهان** is spelled with a single هـ (he) in شاه, consistent with contemporary epigraphic practice.
- No diacritical marks are present on the slab; vowel sounds must be inferred from context.

## Paleographic Observations

- The script shows moderate taʿlīq influence, with elongated horizontal strokes in **میر** and **باقی**.
- The ligature between **مسجد** and **میر** is broken, suggesting the carver treated each word as a discrete unit.
- The stone surface exhibits weathering, especially around the edges, but the central portion of the text remains legible.
