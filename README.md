# Mir Baqi Inscription: A Collaborative Scholarly Annotation Project

## Project Purpose

This repository hosts a detailed, version-controlled, and peer-reviewed annotation of the Mir Baqi inscription—an early 16th‑century Persian epigraph traditionally associated with the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. The goal is not to prove a particular narrative but to model a rigorous and transparent scholarly process for analyzing a contested historical source. By documenting transcription, translation, and interpretive debates in a structured format, we aim to establish a baseline resource that can be extended and refined by other researchers.

## Methodology

The analysis follows two parallel tracks:

1. **Textual Analysis**  
   - Critical edition of the Persian inscription with notes on paleography and orthography.  
   - Multiple translation possibilities, highlighting ambiguous terms and phrases.  
   - Comparative references to contemporary epigraphic conventions in Mughal and Sultanate India.

2. **Architectural Comparison**  
   - Examination of the inscription’s placement, calligraphic style, and material (sandstone).  
   - Comparison with other 16th‑century Islamic foundation inscriptions in North India (e.g., from the reign of Babur and the early Mughal period).  
   - Consideration of how such inscriptions functioned within the broader urban and religious landscape of Ayodhya.

## Disclaimer

This project acknowledges the intense historical, religious, and political controversies surrounding the site of Ayodhya and the claim of a pre‑existing Ram Temple. The present work does **not** seek to adjudicate those controversies. Instead, it treats the Mir Baqi inscription as a material artifact whose language, context, and architectural setting can be studied through standard philological and historical methods. All contributions are expected to maintain a neutral, evidence‑based tone and to cite primary sources and scholarly literature where possible.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch for your proposed annotation or analysis.
2. **Open an Issue** to discuss a specific point of ambiguity (e.g., a disputed term, a historical reference).
3. **Submit a Pull Request** with your edited transcription, translation, or a new analysis file.
4. **Participate in peer review** by commenting on open PRs and helping to refine interpretations.
