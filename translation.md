# Mir Baqi Inscription – Baseline English Translation

## Literal Translation

> *The builder of this mosque is Mir Baqi, from the servants of Shah Jahan.*

## Alternative Renderings

1. **Shah Jahan** – This could refer to the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned 1628‑1658), but the inscription is traditionally dated to 1528 (the reign of Babur). The term may be used as a generic honorific (“King of the World”) rather than a specific regnal name.
2. **from the servants of** – The Persian phrase *از بندگان* (az bandagān) literally means “from among the slaves/servants.” In Mughal chancery language, it denotes a subordinate official or a devoted follower.

## Notes on Contested Phrases

### بندگان شاه جهان
- **Literal:** “servants/slaves of Shah Jahan.”
- **Historical Problem:** If “Shah Jahan” is understood as the later emperor, the inscription would be anachronistic. Some scholars propose that *Shah Jahan* here is a title for Babur, who was sometimes called *Shah‑i‑Jahan* in contemporary panegyrics.
- **Architectural Implication:** The phrase may indicate that Mir Baqi was a high‑ranking official in the imperial administration, authorized to commission religious buildings.

### میر باقی
- The name **Mir Baqi** is well attested in early Mughal chronicles as a noble under Babur. The same individual is mentioned in the *Bāburnāma* as having been assigned to Awadh.
- The title **Mir** (from Arabic *amīr*) signals a commander or local governor.
